We must iu general judge of friendships (74) when thc

⁸ character and age are settled3 and our affection (75) must

be tempercd with discretion.

It sometimes happens (XXI.) that friendships must be
given up3 this should be done gradually and considerately,
that they may not degenerata (1· 8) into open eumity.

To obviate all the risks incident to friendship we must be
careful (1· 9) not to form attachments hastily‚ and to choosc

But (91) as mutual counsel is necessary in true friendship,
so nothing is worse than flattery and insincerity3 for it dc-
stroys truth (92), which is the essence of friendship.

And thc true man (95) can easily bc distinguished from
