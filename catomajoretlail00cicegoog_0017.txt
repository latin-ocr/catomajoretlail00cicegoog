xii INTRODUOTION.

, great learning, He was, in fact, with Scipio at the head of
the literary movement of the time. An embassy from Ath-
ens had visited Rome in 155, consisting of Carneades the
Academia philosopher, Critolaus the Peripatetic, aud Dioge-
nes the Stoic; and from this time dates the more general
interest in Greek culture among the Romans. The influence
was at first sternly resisted, as likely to corrupt the public
morals3 but such prejudices gradually were overcome, or at
least were of uo practica] weight One powerful agent of
progress was the literary circle that gethered around Scipio
and Laelius, of which Polybius the historian, Lucilius the
satirist, Terentius and Pacuvius the dramatists were mem·
bers3 and this was the rallyingpoint of the new learning.

XIII. But Scipio, of whom we have spoken above, aud Lae
lius were intimato not in literary pursuits alone, they had
served together in thc field, especially at the destruction of
Carthagc, and had lived together at home. Plutarch men-
tions a common saying, that Laelius was the writer of the
play in which Scipio was the actor. They were to some ex·
tent complementa of each other, Scipio preeminently the
man of war, Laelius the philosopher. Horace, Serm. II. l,
72, speaks of Virtus Scipiadae, et mitia sapientia Lucii.
Cicero, Brut. 21, 84, says, Ut er bellico laude adspirare od
Africanam ccmo potest . . . sic ingenii, litterarum, eloquentiae,
sapientiae denique etsi utrique mmor, priores tamea lubenter
deferunt Laelio. And it was a singular coincidence that a
similar friendship had existed between the father of Laelius
and thc elder Africanus.

The choice of Laelius for the chief speaker in our dia-
loguc was thus a very happy one. His friendship with
Scipio had become proverbia13 his character vas such asto
win the regard of all who knew him3 his learning, acquaint
unce with the old order of ideas and sympathy with the new
learning, his honesty and patriotism, gavea certain authority
to all his utterances.

One must bear in mind, however, in reading the book, that
we arc not to expect the precision of a philosophical treatise..
