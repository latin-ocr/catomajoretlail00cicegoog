, VIII. The listeners a're Scipio and Laelius. The two sons'
ef the elder Africanus never attained distinction, the younger
en account ef his viciens habits, the elder because ef feeble
’· health. The latter, however, adopted the second son of L.
Aemilius Paulus, the victer at the battle of Pydna in 168,
who was therefore called P. Scipio Africanus by adoption
and Aemilianus from his natural father. At the age of sev·
enteen he fought at the battle of Pydna, and was military
tribune in 151. At the beginning ef the third Punic war
he shewed himself so ables soldier that, although he aspired
only to be aedile, the peeple elected him before the legal age
to be consul in 1473 and in 146 he conqucrcd arid destroyed
Carthago, thus earning the title ef Africanus by his own
achievcments. He was censorin 142, consul again in 134,

ef the Gracchi.; his unconccaled satisfactien at the death
of Tib. Gracchus cest him the favor ef the peeple (dicit Tib.

the senate, of which the effect would have been to nullify
the agrarian law of Gracchus, and advocated it ina violent

crowd of supporters, he was found dead in his bed on the'
succccding morning. Suspicione of foul play fell upon sev·

But Scipio was more than aseldier3 his education had
been thoreugh and comprehensive, and he was 'very much
devoted te literature and literary men. But ef this and of
his friendship with Laelius we shall speah further on.

s Scipio’s sister had been married to Cato’s eldest s0n3 and
this circumstance, besides his own intimacy with Cato based
on a veneratiou fer his character and learning, probably sug·
gested his introductien into the De Senectute.
