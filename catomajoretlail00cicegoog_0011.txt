times, and, when the civil wars broke out, he retired to Ath-
ens. Here he lived for along time engaged in commercial
affairs and literary pursuits; and such were his personal
character and accomplishments that his house became a
resort for distinguished men of the most different charac- .

posed to have been given him from this long residence aud

from his wide knowledge of Greek literature; he is said to
have spoken and written the langnage with the greatest ease.

be fixed approximately by inferences from casual mention in
other works. In the introduction to the second book of the
De Divinatione Cicero gives an account of his philosophical
works up to that time, and after citing the Hortensius, Aca·

We learn from this passage that the Cato Maior was in-
teriectus between the De Natura, the De Divinatione, and
the Consolatio, 1. a, written at some time during the compo-
sition of those works. There arc two passages in the De
Nature from which we infer that that treatise was written
after the death of Cicero's daughter Tullia* and during the
