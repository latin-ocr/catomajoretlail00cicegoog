rwrnonuc'mow. xiii

We are constantly reminded in the beginning that the friend·
ship in question is not that of the Stoic sage, but that of
common life. Besides, Laelius always speaks as a Roman,
and as a Roman conservative; and the prejudices and sym·
pathies of the writer himself are always very apparent.
Many commentatore find political allusions everywhere, tak-
ing the term boni, for instance, as almost always equivalent
to optimates. But this is an extremc view. The treatisc is
intended to be simply an cssay on friendship as we meet it
everywhere3 and, if we may infer from occasional expres-
sions that Cicero thought “ the good '’ were to be found only
among the optimates, and the bad in the popular party, yet
this is rather an evidence of his strong party feeling than of
any intention to give a politicnl coloring to his work.

XIV. The listeners arc Q, Mucius Scaevola and C. Fannius,
the two sons-in-law of Laelius. Thc former will be spoken
. of in a note on §13 the latter served with distinction at Car·
thage in 146, and against> Viriathus in 142. He also wrote
a history of the third Punic war, of the exploits of the
younger Scipio, and of the Gracchian troubles. ,

Cicero mentions a conversation of Laelius as the ground·
work of his dialogus. Gellius, N. A. I. 3, 10, states that he
also made use of a treatise of Theophrastus περὶ pollac: and
several quotations from Greek authors will be pointed out in

. the notes.

XV. From the short introduction (1. 1-5) we learn that
Cicero had heard from Scaevola an account of a conversa·
tion which Laelius had athis house with his two sonsin-
law, Ο. Fannius and Scaevola himself, a few days after the
death of Scipio Africanus (129); and it is not improbable
that such a conversation actually took place. The author then
explainsto Atticus the purpose of writing the book and the rea·
son for choosing Laelius as the chief speaker in the dialogus.

Fannius (ΙΙ. 6), already in the middle of the conversation,
refers to the death of Scipi03 and Scaevola (8) joins him in
asking Laelius what had bcen the effect upon him of so
great a loss.
