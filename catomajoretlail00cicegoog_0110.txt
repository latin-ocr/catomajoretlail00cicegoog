“marked out” and defined, 11 that each part has its appropriate
duties and pleasures. 1111111111 11 ‘⁴ to describe ;” in our text
this distinction is always observed‚ although naturally the MSS.
readings arc not consistent. The comparison of human life to a
drama occurs also in ξς 64,10,85.

common 11 the MSS. os cicero and Caesar, and 11111 occurs even
in imperial times; 1ο 8,13 peranda, and especially where a· pre-

well,'' ‘⁴ if l may be allowed to promise, ete.’' We should¹ rather
expect here the common phrase, 11 pra Scipione respondeam
pollioear, “promise'’ is perhaps used because, if what ‘Oato is
about to do is aratiaaimam, it will obligo the listeners gratiae
