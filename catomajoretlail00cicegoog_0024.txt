INTRQDUCTION. xjx
t 9, Oct, which is now designated as V3 and Voss. N 0. 104,

· Fol, designated as v. V appears to he of considerable

valne for criticism3 for instance, it is one of the very few
' which have not the gloss ignobilia in ξ 8. Dahl's collation
has the additional interest that he gives several parallel read·
ings from P and L; and those from Lare not always the
same as they have been hitherto given.

XVIII. For the commentary a great many editions have
been used; in the Cato Maior perhaps those of Sommerbrodt
and Lahmeyer have been the most useful; for theLcela'aa that
of Seyffert-Miiller.¹ The difficulty of editing works which
have been so much studied is chiefly that of choosing the
matter for notes, and the exercise of the necessary patience
for reading the endless commentarios. We have aimed to
make the notes concise and usefnl for studente in the Fresh-
man οι· Sophomore year.

XIX. With regard to orthography it may be mentioned
that Miiller aims to give in his edition, as we suppose, the

spelling current in the time of Cicer03 and, when that was

not uniform, he does not hesitate to preserve the variety found
in the MSS. We have made very few changes in his text
in this respect, being persuaded that the principle is a right
one. The old English, German, and French authors are
published with the spelling of their time, and no one cares
now te read them in a modern dress3 and the surprise at
meeting the same Latin word written in different ways, per-
haps on the same page, soon cesses to trouble us3 some·
times even we discover an interesting fact of language.

A few references are given in the notes to the grammars
of Allen and Greenough (Α G.) and Harkness (ΗΝ)

The whole worlr has been carefully revised by Professor ·
Drisler, to whom the editor desires to express his thanks for
many hind suggestions.
