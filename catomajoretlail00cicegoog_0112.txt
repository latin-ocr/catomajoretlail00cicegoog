-ui‚ quod essct accusandam: The relative clause vvith subj. is
explained by nearly all the commentatore as describing 111111
11111 signisying “of sach a nature that.” But the reference in
111 11 definite, namely, to the 110111 (l. 13 11 moribus eat culpo),
and the sense 01 thc passage' seems to be: “It did not seem to
me that they blamed that (namely, their cvvn characters) which
should have been blamed,” i. e. 11 they had laid the blame where
it vvas deserved. The case is an exception to the rule alluded
to in 42, 281, and is one 01 the rare cases where the imp. suhj. 01
those expressions is used 01 an impossible condition in past time.
