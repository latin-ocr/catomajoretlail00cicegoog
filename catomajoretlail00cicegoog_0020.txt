stronger we are (30), the more are wc prone to form friend·

Again the listeners pray him to continue 3 and Laelius (Χ)
quotes the opinion of Scipio, that it was almost impossible
for friendships to last till the end of life3 political interests,
characters changing with years, rivalry in love or ambition,
coms in to break them up; but especially (35) the unreason-
able demand that one should go to all lengths, even to the
doing of wrong, for the sake of a friend.

The question arises then (XI. 36), how far should one's
affection yield to the demands of friendshipi It is no ex·
cuse (37) for doing wrong that you have done so for the
sake of a friend. With some friends (38) we might be

counsel freely, and receive it when given from them. Cer-
tain Greek philosophers (45) have strangely held that too in·
timate friondships should he avoided, so that we may live an
undisturbed life. Others (46), with still 1444 feeling, say that
friendehips are good for the help they bring; they are for
the weak But (47) this tranquillity is of no value3 virtue
itself is of necessity accompanied by some disquiet3 and, ’
if wc avoided that, we should become stocks or stenes.

Since, then (XIV.), friendship grows out of the sympathy
and love excited by virtue, we should place it above the
common pleasures of life. It is founded in nature (50) and
is a necessary thing3 and virtue, from which it springs, is a
